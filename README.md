## **Description**
This application was built for the intention of sharpening some of my older developer skills like the "Flexbox Model". In this application you will fine the use of flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.

<br>

With todays forever evolving technology media queries allow for your application to become "responsive". It allows you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport. Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones such as iPhone and Android phones. In my application I set my media query breakpoints to max-width: 992px and max-width 768px. See demo images below.

 Flexbox is a method for defining how components of a page behave across different devices and screen sizes. Flexbox was named for its "flexible" nature. It offers several benefits like dynamic rearranging, alignment, and direction. In my application I used a "flex container" with a value of display "flex" to set my images in a responsive row. In order for my row to respond as the screen size changed I added "flex wrap" for the image to fall onto another line. See demo images.
